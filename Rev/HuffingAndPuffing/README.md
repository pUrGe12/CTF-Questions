To compile the binary for a CTF challenge, 

    g++ -d --static -o name.exe question.cpp

The additional flags are to make sure that the binary can be analysed through a decompiling software like Ghidra or IDA. 

The code is not complete and hence won't compile. The section on huffman functions is left out on purpose.
